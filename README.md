# Gamecube BIOS UI simulator
## Description
This is a work-in-progress attempt to recreate the Gamecube IPL UI using Three.js.

## Installation & Usage
```
$ git clone https://github.com/etiandre/gcuisim.git
$ npm install
$ npm start
```
## Details
 - The font used is Source Sans Pro Bold, as the original IPL font is hard to obtain and probably copyrighted.
 - The shiny reflection texture is the original one (see https://tcrf.net/GameCube).
 - The cube model is (for now) a bad attempt at recreating the original one.

## TODO
 - Loading screen
 - Sound
 - Dynamic navigation
 - Particle effects
 - Second type of screen
